CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findopencv_bridge.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "opencv_bridge", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "opencv_bridge"
  with any of the following names:

    opencv_bridgeConfig.cmake
    opencv_bridge-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "opencv_bridge" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "opencv_bridge_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "opencv_bridge" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
